# Introduction

This directory is used to store static assets for your project. User media files
(FileFields/ImageFields) are not stored here.

The convention for this directory is:

 * css/ — stores CSS files
 * less/ - stores LESS files
 * js/ — stores Javascript files
 * img/ — stores image files

# Gulp

Gulp can be used to automatically build css from LESS files.  The gulp process will
watch you LESS files for changes and recompile.  To install gulp do
the following 2 steps:

1.  cd into the project directory and install dependencies with `npm install`
2.  install gulp command line globally with `sudo npm install -g gulp`
